<!--
This configuration is essential for securely sharing files from the app's private
storage with other applications. It is used by the FileProvider.

The <cache-path> tag specifies that we are allowing access to a subdirectory
named "exports" within our app's dedicated cache directory. This is the recommended
approach for sharing temporary files like the exported CSV, as the system can
clear the cache to free up space.

    <cache-path
        name="shared_csv_exports"
        path="exports/" />
